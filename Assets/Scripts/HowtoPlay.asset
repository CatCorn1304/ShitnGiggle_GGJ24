  finalText: My young wizard this is your big day! It's time to present your speech
    that you worked very hard on. I don't want to stress you, but your mortal enemy,
    Stanlee, is in the audience! Now listen closely, he is going to sabotage your
    speech by throwing potions at you. If they hit you, you will look very stupid.
    I can patch you up after your speech, but if you get hit three times then you
    will die. Block Stanlee's attacks using your freakishly long arm. Godspeed my
    young wizard!
